A program to generate .rle files out of a grid of integers, where the cells
which correspond to prime numbers are alive and all others are dead.

Building:
	make

Running:
	./seratosthenes [[map width/height]|[map width] [map height]]
	By default, it generates a file name primes.rle which is 512x512
	If you specify one dimension, you get a square that size
	If you specify two dimension, you get a rectangle that size
